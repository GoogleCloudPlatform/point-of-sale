# Point of Sale

**Point of Sale** is a sample application that simulates a retail store kiosk used to submit/track orders and payments. 

This application is used by Google to demonstrate use cases where [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) clusters are installed and run, off of the Google Cloud Platform _(i.e. on premise bare metal infrastructure)_. The application is representative of **edge deployments** like that of retail store front devices. 

This repository also hosts a collection of samples/walkthroughs that enables learning and experimenting with [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) for edge use cases. All the samples/walkthroughs are built around the **Point of Sale** application.

> Note: Anthos clusters means Kubernetes clusters that are managed by Anthos

### Edge computing

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where the action is, to improve response times and save bandwidth. Multiple industries _(e.g. Retail, Telecommunication, Manufacturing and Energy)_ are facing a growing demand to provide localized, consistent, low latency services that expose compute services. Workloads range from order management, ML for images/traffic analysis/safety, device management like refrigeration, fryers, etc. [Anthos clusters on Bare Metal](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal) and [Anthos cluster on VMware](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem) are unique solutions for deploying and managing workloads on clusters distributed across customer data centers and device fleets.

# Anthos Edge Use Cases

The **Anthos Edge Use Cases** repository hosts a collection of samples/walkthroughs that enables learning and experimenting with [Anthos](https://cloud.google.com/anthos) for edge use cases. The core of repository is the [**Point of Sale**](point-of-sale-app) sample application around which the use cases are built.

Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where the action is, to improve response times and save bandwidth. Multiple industries _(e.g. Retail, Telecommunication, Manufacturing and Energy)_ are facing a growing demand to provide localized, consistent, low latency services that expose compute services. Workloads range from order management, ML for images/traffic analysis/safety, device management like refrigeration, fryers, etc. [Anthos clusters on Bare Metal](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal) and [Anthos cluster on VMware](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/on-prem) are unique solutions for deploying and managing workloads on clusters distributed across customer data centers and device fleets.
